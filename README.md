OpenQueueMetricsAddOns
======================

A set of community-contributed scripts for QueueMetrics. This project was originally hosted on SourceForge but was moved to GitHub.

The following projects are hosted:

### The Flantel qmon.php wallboard - Version 1.0 
This is the original script, and a QM users' all-time favourite. Might need some
patching to work with recent versions of QM.
### Qloaderd monitor - Version 1.0 
A script to be run nightly that will notify the sysadmin of the errors encountered in the Qloader's log file.
### Count Agents - Version 1.0 
A PHP script that counts how many unique agents are running on a given set of queues and period
### Remove all agents - Version 1.0
A bash script that removes all dynamic agents from a queue.
### Sample project - Version 1.0 
This is a sample project to show standard file layout for sub-projects.

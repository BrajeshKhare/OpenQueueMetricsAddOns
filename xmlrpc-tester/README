qm_xmltester
===================

This is a simple Java Servlet for testing XML-RPC with QueueMetrics.

http://www.queuemetrics.com

I use it with Tomcat it should work with any servlet container.

I wrote this several years ago for my own use, it's handy for seeing the exact output from the various XML-RPC requests from Queuemetrics while writing your custom reports.

There is a single Java class in the WEB-INF/classes folder, this does all the work.  

There is a simple compile bash script too.  The WEB-INF/lib folder contains the 3rd party Java packages you'll need to compile against.

For now the URL to the XML-RPC server is hard-coded into the code so this needs editing.  If I get round to it I'll put this into an input box on the web page and/or a settings file.

Just put the xmlrpc-tester folder into your webapps folder, restart tomcat and web browse to the URL for your servlet container /xmlrpc-tester/xmltest

There's a basic web.xml config file in there which will get it working.  I've used it with Tomcat 5, 5.5, 6 & 7.

Have fun.
